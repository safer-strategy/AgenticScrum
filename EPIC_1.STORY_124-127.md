Of course. Now that we have a detailed story for the advanced developer agent and environment setup, let's break down the remaining core functionality of the `AgenticScrum Setup Utility` into additional user stories.

To organize this, we can group all of these foundational tasks under a single epic. `Story 123` will also be part of this epic.

**Epic 01: AgenticScrum Core Scaffolding** - Implement the foundational features of the setup utility to generate a complete, structured, and configurable agentic project.

Here are the new stories to fully implement the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as defined in the project brief.

### **Story 124: Implement Core CLI and Project Directory Scaffolding**

# Story 124: Implement Core CLI and Project Directory Scaffolding

**Epic:** 01 - AgenticScrum Core Scaffolding
**Story Points:** 2
**Priority:** P1 (High - This is the foundational entry point for the entire utility)
**Status:** Done

## ðŸ“‹ User Story

**As a** Developer, **I want** a command-line interface (CLI) with an `init` command, **so that** I can create a standardized, hierarchical project directory structure for a new AgenticScrum project.

## ðŸŽ¯ Acceptance Criteria

### CLI Functionality
- [x] [cite_start]**`init` Command**: A CLI command `agentic-scrum-setup init` must be available. [cite: 234]
- [x] [cite_start]**Project Name Argument**: The `init` command must accept a `--project-name` argument to specify the root directory name. [cite: 234]
- [x] [cite_start]**Language Argument**: The `init` command must accept a `--language` argument (e.g., `python`, `javascript`) to tailor language-specific files. [cite: 235]

### Directory Structure Generation
- [x] [cite_start]**Root Directory Creation**: The utility must create a root project directory with the specified project name. [cite: 235]
- [x] [cite_start]**Core Directories**: The following core subdirectories must be created within the root directory: `/agents`, `/src`, `/tests`, `/docs`, `/standards`, `/checklists`, and `/scripts`. [cite: 32, 47, 60, 62, 63, 67, 73, 74]
- [x] [cite_start]**Global Configuration**: A global `agentic_config.yaml` must be generated in the root directory for project-wide settings like LLM providers and API keys. [cite: 48]
- [x] [cite_start]**Project Documentation**: A template `README.md` and a standard `.gitignore` file must be created in the root directory. [cite: 49, 50]
- [x] [cite_start]**Dependency File**: A language-appropriate dependency file (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) must be generated in the root directory. [cite: 51]

### **Story 125: Generate Core Non-Developer Agent Personas**

# Story 125: Generate Core Non-Developer Agent Personas

**Epic:** 01 - AgenticScrum Core Scaffolding
**Story Points:** 2
**Priority:** P1 (High - These agents are essential for the Scrum workflow)
**Status:** Done

## ðŸ“‹ User Story

**As a** Developer, **I want** the setup utility to generate the configurations for the core `ProductOwnerAgent`, `ScrumMasterAgent`, and `QAAgent`, **so that** the project is initialized with the full set of roles required for the AgenticScrum workflow.

## ðŸŽ¯ Acceptance Criteria

### Agent Scaffolding
- [x] [cite_start]**Agent Selection**: The `init` command must accept an `--agents` flag to specify which agents to generate (e.g., `poa`, `sma`, `qaa`). [cite: 234]
- [x] [cite_start]**ProductOwnerAgent (POA)**: If `poa` is selected, the utility must create a `/agents/product_owner_agent/` directory. [cite: 52] [cite_start]This directory must contain a template `persona_rules.yaml` and `priming_script.md` for the POA. [cite: 53, 54]
- [x] [cite_start]**ScrumMasterAgent (SMA)**: If `sma` is selected, the utility must create an `/agents/scrum_master_agent/` directory with its corresponding `persona_rules.yaml` and `priming_script.md`. [cite: 57]
- [x] [cite_start]**QAAgent (QAA)**: If `qaa` is selected, the utility must create an `/agents/qa_agent/` directory with its corresponding `persona_rules.yaml` and `priming_script.md`. [cite: 59]

### Persona Content
- [x] [cite_start]**POA Rules**: The POA's `persona_rules.yaml` must include responsibilities like managing the product backlog and translating feature requests into user stories. [cite: 83]
- [x] [cite_start]**SMA Rules**: The SMA's `persona_rules.yaml` must include responsibilities like facilitating the AgenticScrum process, monitoring agent interactions, and flagging impediments. [cite: 85]
- [x] [cite_start]**QAA Rules**: The QAA's `persona_rules.yaml` must include responsibilities like reviewing code, executing tests, and verifying adherence to the Definition of Done. [cite: 90]

### **Story 126: Generate Project Standards and Process Checklists**

# Story 126: Generate Project Standards and Process Checklists

**Epic:** 01 - AgenticScrum Core Scaffolding
**Story Points:** 1
**Priority:** P2 (Medium - Essential for ensuring quality and consistency)
**Status:** Done

## ðŸ“‹ User Story

**As a** Developer, **I want** the setup utility to generate template files for coding standards and process checklists, **so that** code quality, consistency, and process adherence are built into the project from the start.

## ðŸŽ¯ Acceptance Criteria

### Standards Generation
- [x] [cite_start]**`coding_standards.md`**: The utility must generate a `coding_standards.md` file in the `/standards` directory with template sections for naming conventions, commenting, and style guides. [cite: 68, 118]
- [x] [cite_start]**Linter Configurations**: The utility must generate default configuration files for common linters and formatters in the `/standards/linter_configs/` directory, tailored to the selected language (e.g., a `pyproject.toml` with Black/Flake8 settings for Python). [cite: 69, 123, 124]

### Checklist Generation
- [x] [cite_start]**`definition_of_done.md`**: The utility must generate a `definition_of_done.md` file in the `/checklists` directory with a template checklist defining criteria for story completion. [cite: 71]
- [x] [cite_start]**`code_review_checklist.md`**: The utility must generate a `code_review_checklist.md` file in the `/checklists` directory for use by QAAgents and human reviewers. [cite: 72]
- [x] [cite_start]**`sprint_planning_checklist.md`**: The utility must generate a `sprint_planning_checklist.md` file in the `/checklists` directory to guide the planning process. [cite: 73]

### **Story 127: Implement Interactive CLI Setup Mode**

# Story 127: Implement Interactive CLI Setup Mode

**Epic:** 01 - AgenticScrum Core Scaffolding
**Story Points:** 2
**Priority:** P2 (Medium - Improves usability for new or infrequent users)
**Status:** Done

## ðŸ“‹ User Story

**As a** new user of the utility, **I want** the `init` command to launch an interactive, guided setup if I run it without arguments, **so that** I can easily configure a new project without needing to memorize all the command-line flags.

## ðŸŽ¯ Acceptance Criteria

### Interactive Behavior
- [x] [cite_start]**Trigger Condition**: If `agentic-scrum-setup init` is run with no additional arguments, the CLI MUST enter an interactive mode. [cite: 238]
- [x] [cite_start]**Project Name Prompt**: The CLI must prompt the user to enter the project name. [cite: 239, 240]
- [x] [cite_start]**Language Selection Prompt**: The CLI must prompt the user to select the primary programming language from a predefined list. [cite: 240]
- [x] [cite_start]**Agent Selection Prompt**: The CLI must prompt the user to choose which core agent personas to include. [cite: 240]
- [x] [cite_start]**LLM Provider Prompt**: The CLI must prompt the user to specify a default LLM provider (e.g., openai, anthropic, google). [cite: 240]
- [x] **Successful Generation**: Upon completion of the prompts, the utility must generate the complete project structure and files just as it would if the values were passed as flags.

These stories, combined with Story 123, provide a comprehensive plan for delivering the core MVP of the AgenticScrum Setup Utility. Future work, such as the Web UI, advanced orchestration, and IDE integration, can be planned in a subsequent epic.
