## üìö Template Usage Guidelines

### When Creating a New Story:

1. **Replace all bracketed placeholders** with specific information
2. **Delete unused sections** if they don't apply to your story
3. **Add additional sections** if needed for complex stories
4. **Be specific and actionable** - avoid vague requirements
5. **Include line numbers and file paths** when referencing existing code
6. **Provide code examples** for complex technical changes
7. **Organize acceptance criteria** into logical groups
8. **Estimate time for each phase** in the implementation plan

### Quality Checklist for New Stories:

- [ ] User story follows "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]" format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific, testable, and complete
- [ ] Technical implementation includes specific file paths and line numbers
- [ ] All dependencies are identified and their status is clear
- [ ] Testing requirements cover unit, integration, and manual scenarios
- [ ] Implementation plan is broken into logical phases with time estimates
- [ ] Story can be completed by a developer without additional context gathering

### Story Sizing Guidelines:

- **1 Point**: Simple changes, single component, < 2 hours
- **2 Points**: Medium complexity, multiple components, 2-4 hours  
- **3 Points**: Complex changes, cross-cutting concerns, 4-8 hours

If a story exceeds 3 points, consider breaking it into multiple stories.
