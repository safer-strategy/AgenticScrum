## **Overview**

The rise of sophisticated AI agents for code generation offers immense potential but often lacks standardized processes, leading to challenges in managing multiple agents, ensuring code quality, and scaling efforts.

**AgenticScrum** addresses these challenges by:

* Integrating core Scrum methodologies with specialized AI agents.  
* Providing a setup utility to automate the creation of a standardized project structure.  
* Generating foundational rules and persona definitions for AI agents.  
* Incorporating coding standards and priming scripts to initialize agent behavior.

This framework aims to bring predictability, quality control, and collaborative structure to AI-assisted software development.

## **Core Principles**

AgenticScrum is built upon the following foundational principles:

1. **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and implement, minimizing cognitive overhead.  
2. **Power:** Capable of handling complex code generation tasks through specialized, collaborative AI agents.  
3. **Ease of Use:** Intuitive setup and operational experience, primarily via a Command-Line Interface (CLI).  
4. **Open-Source:** All components are open-source to encourage community contribution, transparency, and evolution.  
5. **Scrum Alignment:** Adapts key Scrum elements (artifacts, roles, events) to an agentic context, providing a familiar structure for agile teams.

## **Key Features**

* **Conversational Onboarding (NEW):** Natural language project setup guided by POA - describe your project in your own words!
* **Automated Project Scaffolding:** CLI utility to instantly set up a standardized project.

## **Getting Started**

### **Project Location Best Practices**

AgenticScrum creates new projects in a designated location to keep your tool installation separate from your development projects. By default, projects are created in:

- **`~/AgenticProjects`** - When running from within the AgenticScrum directory
- **Current directory** - When running from outside AgenticScrum

**Setting up a Workspace:**

```bash
# Create a dedicated workspace for your projects
./init.sh create-workspace ~/MyProjects

# Or use the default location
./init.sh create-workspace
```

**Environment Variable Configuration:**

```bash
# Set your preferred default location
export AGENTIC_PROJECTS_DIR="$HOME/MyProjects"

# Add to your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc) to make permanent
echo 'export AGENTIC_PROJECTS_DIR="$HOME/MyProjects"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### **The Setup Utility**

The primary way to start an AgenticScrum project is by using the agentic-scrum-setup CLI utility. To simplify the complex command-line arguments, we provide an `init.sh` helper script.

**Quick Start with init.sh:**

```bash
# Install the latest beta release
pip install agentic-scrum-setup==1.0.0b8

# Verify installation
python -c "import agentic_scrum_setup; print(f'AgenticScrum v{agentic_scrum_setup.__version__} installed')"

# Create a new project interactively (recommended for beta testing)
./init.sh new

# Or use quick setup with defaults
./init.sh quick MyNewWebApp
```

> **Beta Testers**: Please see [BETA_LAUNCH.md](BETA_LAUNCH.md) for beta-specific installation instructions and feedback guidelines.

### **Conversational Onboarding (NEW)**

AgenticScrum now offers a natural, conversation-based approach to project setup that's perfect for both new and existing projects:

**Start with Conversational Mode:**
```bash
# Recommended for new users - let POA guide you through setup
agentic-scrum-setup init --conversational

# Or use init.sh
./init.sh new --conversational
```

**How it Works:**
1. **Natural Language Input**: Describe your project in your own words - no technical questionnaires!
2. **Flexible Formats**: Paste an existing PRD, share informal ideas, or provide technical specs
3. **POA Guidance**: Your Product Owner Agent extracts requirements and asks clarifying questions
4. **Automatic Detection**: Recognizes existing projects and offers non-invasive enhancements
5. **Structured Output**: Converts any input into well-organized PRD.md and project structure

**Example Conversation:**
```
POA: Hello! I'm your Product Owner Agent (POA). What would you like to build?

You: I want to create a task management app for remote teams with real-time collaboration

POA: That sounds interesting! Let me understand better:
- Who will be the primary users of this system?
- What are the key features you envision?

[Continue natural conversation until requirements are complete]
```

**Benefits:**
- **Zero Learning Curve**: No need to understand AgenticScrum's structure upfront
- **Retrofitting Support**: Enhances existing projects without modifying your code
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: POA adjusts to your technical level and communication style
- **Complete Documentation**: Automatically generates PRD.md, epics, and project summaries

**Direct CLI Usage:**

Single language project:
```bash
agentic-scrum-setup init \
  --project-name MyNewWebApp \
  --language python \
  --framework fastapi \
  --agents poa,sma,deva_python,qaa,saa \
  --llm-provider anthropic \
  --default-model claude-sonnet-4-0 \
  --output-dir ~/AgenticProjects
```

Fullstack project:
```bash
agentic-scrum-setup init \
  --project-name MyFullstackApp \
  --project-type fullstack \
  --language python \
  --backend-framework fastapi \
  --frontend-language typescript \
  --frontend-framework react \
  --agents poa,sma,deva_python,deva_typescript,qaa,saa \
  --llm-provider anthropic \
  --default-model claude-sonnet-4-0 \
  --output-dir ~/AgenticProjects
```

This command will:

1. Create a new project directory in the specified output location (e.g., ~/AgenticProjects/MyNewWebApp/).  
2. Generate a standardized hierarchical directory structure (see below).  
3. Create agent configuration files (persona\_rules.yaml) and priming\_script.md for each specified agent.  
4. Generate template documents for coding standards (coding\_standards.md) and linter configurations.  
5. Create an agentic\_config.yaml for global project settings.  
6. Scaffold checklist documents like definition\_of\_done.md.

If run interactively (e.g., agentic-scrum-setup init), the CLI will prompt for necessary information including the output directory.

### **Claude Code Integration**

AgenticScrum is optimized for use with Claude Code (claude.ai/code). When using Claude Code:

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
# Use the --claude-code flag for optimal defaults
agentic-scrum-setup init --project-name MyProject --language python --agents poa,sma,deva_python,qaa --claude-code
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatic selection of Anthropic provider and claude-sonnet-4-0 model
- Model parameters (temperature, max_tokens) are controlled by Claude Code IDE
- Agent configurations include model recommendations for different tasks
- Seamless integration with Claude Code's model switching commands

**Model Selection Strategy:**
- Use `/model opus` for complex planning and architecture tasks
- Use `/model sonnet` (default) for development and implementation
- Use `/model haiku` for quick, simple tasks

### **MCP Integration (Model Context Protocol)**

AgenticScrum now supports MCP servers to enhance agent capabilities beyond Claude Code's native features:

**Enable MCP Features:**
```bash
# Create project with MCP integration
agentic-scrum-setup init \
  --project-name "MyEnhancedProject" \
  --language python \
  --agents poa,sma,deva_python,qaa \
  --enable-mcp \
  --enable-search

# Configure API keys (required for search)
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

**MCP Benefits:**
- **Persistent Memory**: Agents remember past decisions, patterns, and solutions across sessions
- **Advanced Search**: Global web search via Perplexity (not limited to US like native search)
- **Learning Agents**: Performance improves over time as agents build knowledge
- **Secure Configuration**: API keys managed through environment variables

For detailed MCP setup, see the [MCP Integration Guide](docs/MCP_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md).

### **Retrofitting Existing Projects**

AgenticScrum can be gradually integrated into existing codebases without disrupting current workflows. This approach is ideal for teams who want to leverage AI agents without starting from scratch.

**Quick Start for Retrofitting:**

```bash
# Assess your existing project
python scripts/retrofit_project.py assess --path /path/to/your/project

# Generate a customized retrofit plan
python scripts/retrofit_project.py plan --path /path/to/your/project

# Initialize agents for your specific tech stack
python scripts/retrofit_project.py init-agents --path /path/to/your/project \
  --languages python,javascript --frameworks django,react
```

**Key Benefits of Retrofitting:**
- **Non-disruptive integration** - Keep your existing structure and workflows
- **Gradual adoption** - Start with one agent, expand as comfortable
- **Respect existing patterns** - Agents learn and match your code style
- **Preserve team dynamics** - Enhance rather than replace current processes

For detailed retrofitting instructions, see the [Retrofitting Guide](docs/RETROFITTING_GUIDE.md).

## **Project Directory Structure**

A well-defined structure is crucial. AgenticScrum proposes the following:

```
MyNewWebApp/  
├── agentic_config.yaml       # Global AgenticScrum settings (LLM provider, API keys, etc.)  
├── README.md                 # Project overview and setup

│   └── security_audit_checklist.md  
│  
└── scripts/                  # Utility scripts for automation (e.g., run_linters.sh)
```

This structure is inspired by best practices from frameworks like CrewAI [1] and LangGraph [3].

## **The AgenticScrum Workflow**

### **Agent Personas & Rules**

Effective agentic systems rely on well-defined "persona engineering."

* **Core Agents:**  
  * **ProductOwnerAgent (POA):** Manages product backlog, creates user stories.  
  * **ScrumMasterAgent (SMA):** Facilitates the process, monitors interactions, flags impediments.  
  * **DeveloperAgent (DevA):** Generates code and unit tests based on user stories. Can be specialized (e.g., PythonDeveloperAgent).  
  * **QAAgent (QAA):** Reviews code, runs tests, ensures adherence to Definition of Done.  
  * **SecurityAuditAgent (SAA):** Conducts comprehensive security audits, identifies vulnerabilities, ensures secure coding practices.  
* **persona_rules.yaml:** Located in each agent's directory (e.g., /agents/developer_agent/persona_rules.yaml), this file defines:  
  * role: The agent's primary function.  
  * goal: The agent's main objective.  
  * backstory: Context for the LLM to adopt the persona.  
  * llm\_config: Specific LLM settings (model, temperature).  
  * capabilities: List of skills.  
  * rules: Specific operational heuristics and constraints.  
  * knowledge\_sources: Pointers to relevant documents (standards, checklists).  
  * tools: (Conceptual) Placeholder for future tool integrations.  
This detailed configuration, inspired by practices in BMAD-METHOD [5], guides the LLM's behavior.

### **Priming Scripts**

Located in [agent_dir]/priming_script.md, these scripts are the initial textual input to the LLM:

* Invoke the specific agent persona by referencing its persona\_rules.yaml.  
* Set the context and define the immediate task or mission.  
* Point to necessary resources (user stories, coding standards).  
* Specify output expectations and contingency instructions.

### **Coding Standards**

AgenticScrum integrates coding standards through:

1. **standards/coding_standards.md:** A human-readable document detailing naming conventions, commenting guidelines, style guides, etc.  
2. **standards/linter_configs/:** Configuration files for automated linters (e.g., Flake8, ESLint) and formatters (e.g., Black, Prettier).  

Enforcement occurs via:  
* Explicit rules in agent persona_rules.yaml.  
* Reinforcement in priming_script.md.  
* Checklist items in checklists/code_review_checklist.md for the QAAgent.

### **Workflow Orchestration (Future Feature)**

> **Note:** Automated workflow orchestration is planned for future releases. Currently, agents operate independently and require manual coordination.

The conceptual sprint lifecycle that will be automated includes:

1. **Sprint Planning:** POA generates user stories from high-level goals.  
2. **User Story Assignment:** Stories assigned to appropriate DevAs.  
3. **Development:** DevAs generate code and unit tests.  
4. **Security Audit:** SAA performs comprehensive security review of the code.  
5. **Code Review & QA:** QAA reviews code, runs tests, verifies against Definition of Done.  
6. **Daily Stand-up (Conceptual):** Agents report status, SMA logs progress/impediments.  
7. **Sprint Review:** Human stakeholders review completed work.  
8. **Sprint Retrospective:** Analyze agent performance and process for improvements.

**Planned integrations:**
- Automated sprint lifecycle management
- Agent interaction coordination
- Integration with CrewAI [6], AutoGen [6], or LangGraph [6]
- Full POA → SMA → DevA → QAA → SAA workflow automation

### **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**

Human oversight is critical [9]. Responsibilities include:

* Setting strategic direction.  
* Reviewing and approving agent outputs (especially user stories, final code).  
* Resolving complex ambiguities.  
* Making critical design decisions.  
* Continuously refining agent personas and prompts.

## **Multi-Stack and Multi-Repository Support**

AgenticScrum supports three project types to handle any software architecture:

### **Organization Management**

**NEW:** Enterprise-grade multi-repository management with AI agent coordination:

```bash
# Create an organization to manage multiple repositories
agentic-scrum-setup init --project-type organization --organization-name "MyCompany"

# Add repositories to the organization
agentic-scrum-setup add-repo \
  --organization-dir MyCompany \
  --repo-name "api-service" \
  --language python \
  --framework fastapi \
  --agents poa,sma,deva_python,qaa

# List all repositories in organization
agentic-scrum-setup list-repos --organization-dir MyCompany
```

**Organization Features:**
* **Portfolio-Level Planning:** Organization POA manages product strategy across all repositories
* **Cross-Project Coordination:** Organization SMA coordinates sprints and dependencies across teams
* **Shared Standards:** Consistent coding standards, security policies, and best practices
* **Configuration Inheritance:** Organization settings cascade to individual repositories
* **Shared Infrastructure:** Common databases, monitoring, CI/CD, and development tools
* **Agent Memory Sharing:** Cross-project pattern recognition and knowledge transfer

**Organization Structure:**
```
MyOrganization/
├── .agentic/                      # Organization configuration
│   ├── agentic_config.yaml        # Organization-wide settings

└── docs/                         # Organization documentation
```

### **Single and Fullstack Projects**

* **Single Language Projects:**
  ```bash
  agentic-scrum-setup init --project-name "MyAPI" --language python --framework fastapi
  ```

* **Fullstack Projects:**
  ```bash
  agentic-scrum-setup init \
    --project-type fullstack \
    --language python \
    --backend-framework fastapi \
    --frontend-language typescript \
    --frontend-framework react
  ```
  * Automatically creates `/backend` and `/frontend` directories with appropriate structures
  * Generates multiple DeveloperAgents for different languages (e.g., `deva_python` for backend, `deva_typescript` for frontend)
  * Separate standards and linter configurations for each stack

**Use Cases:**
* **Organizations:** Enterprise teams managing multiple related services and applications
* **Fullstack:** Single applications with distinct backend and frontend components  
* **Single:** Individual microservices, libraries, or standalone applications

**Agent Coordination Across Project Types:**
* **Organization Level:** Portfolio POA + Cross-project SMA coordinate across all repositories
* **Repository Level:** Individual POA, SMA, and developer agents for each project
* **Shared Memory:** Agents learn from patterns across the entire organization

## **Inspiration**

AgenticScrum draws inspiration from pioneering open-source frameworks, adapting their successful patterns into a Scrum-like context:

* **BMAD-METHOD [5]:**  
  Influences persona engineering, detailed prompting, and the crucial role of checklists.  
* **CrewAI [6]:**  
  Informs the standardized project structure, YAML-based agent definitions, and role-based agent collaboration.  
* **AutoGen [6]:**  
  Provides models for multi-agent communication and orchestration.  
* **LangGraph [6]:**  
  Offers paradigms for complex, stateful multi-agent interactions.

## **Benefits**

* **Increased Efficiency & Speed:** Automates parts of coding, documentation, and testing [9].  
* **Improved Consistency:** Standardized personas, rules, and coding standards.  
* **Enhanced Code Quality (Potentially):** Systematic QA by QAAgents and feedback loops [9].  
* **Improved Security:** Automated security audits by SecurityAuditAgent to identify vulnerabilities early.  
* **Scalability:** Structure for distributing tasks among multiple AI agents [9].  
* **Structured Agentic Development:** Methodical process for AI-assisted projects.  
* **Knowledge Centralization:** Explicit definition of personas, rules, and standards.

## **Agent Optimization and Feedback Loops**

AgenticScrum includes a comprehensive system for continuously improving agent performance through feedback loops and automated optimization. This addresses one of the key limitations - the dependence on well-crafted configurations.

### **Key Components:**

* **Performance Metrics Collection**: Automated tracking of code quality, complexity, coverage, and other metrics
* **Feedback Forms**: Structured templates for collecting human feedback on agent performance
* **Automated Analysis**: Scripts that identify patterns in feedback and suggest configuration improvements
* **Configuration Updates**: Tools to apply improvements to persona_rules.yaml and priming_script.md

### **Documentation:**
- [Agent Optimization Guide](docs/AGENT_OPTIMIZATION.md) - Comprehensive guide to crafting effective personas and priming scripts
- [Feedback Workflow](docs/FEEDBACK_WORKFLOW.md) - Step-by-step process for implementing feedback loops
- [Agent Feedback Form](checklists/agent_feedback_form.md) - Template for collecting structured feedback

### **Quick Start:**
```bash
# Collect metrics for agent-generated code
python scripts/collect_agent_metrics.py --agent deva_python --file src/api/users.py --save

# Analyze feedback and generate recommendations
python scripts/update_agent_config.py recommend --agent deva_python

# Apply recommended updates (dry run)
python scripts/update_agent_config.py apply --agent deva_python --dry-run
```

## **Limitations**

* **LLM "Hallucinations":** Requires robust QA and human oversight.  
* **Dependence on Prompt Quality:** Effectiveness hinges on well-crafted persona_rules.yaml and priming_script.md. *(Mitigated by feedback loops and optimization system)*  
* **Agent Management Overhead:** Coordinating multiple agents can be complex.  
* **Current LLM Reasoning Limits:** May struggle with highly novel or abstract problems.  
* **Cost of LLM API Usage:** Can be significant for cloud-based LLMs.  
* **Integration Challenges:** Integrating AI-generated code into existing complex systems.

## **Future Directions**

* **Advanced Orchestration Engine:** Leveraging frameworks like CrewAI, AutoGen, or LangGraph.  
* **Enhanced Tool Integration:** Enabling agents to actively use linters, test runners, VCS, APIs.  
* **Feedback Loops & Agent Learning:** Implementing RAG, learning from human feedback.  
* **Sophisticated Agent Specializations & Collaboration Patterns.**  
* **Community-Driven Development:** Shared repository of personas, rules, and tool integrations.
