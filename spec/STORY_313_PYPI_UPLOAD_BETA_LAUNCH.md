# Build distribution packages
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

# Generated files:
# dist/agentic_scrum_setup-1.0.0b4-py3-none-any.whl (171KB)
# dist/agentic-scrum-setup-1.0.0b4.tar.gz (147KB)
```

**Local Testing:**
```bash
# Install and verify locally
pip install --force-reinstall dist/agentic_scrum_setup-1.0.0b4-py3-none-any.whl

# Verify version
python -c "import agentic_scrum_setup; print(agentic_scrum_setup.__version__)"
# Output: 1.0.0-beta.4
```

### Phase 2: PyPI Account Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED BY USER

**Account Configuration:**
- PyPI account created and verified
- API token generated for secure authentication
- Credentials configured for upload process

### Phase 3: Upload Process ‚úÖ IN PROGRESS

**Step 1: Package Integrity Validation ‚úÖ COMPLETED**
```bash
# Install upload tools
pip install twine
# ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Twine already installed (v6.1.0)

# Validate package integrity
twine check dist/*
# ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Both packages PASSED validation
# - Checking dist/agentic_scrum_setup-1.0.0b4-py3-none-any.whl: PASSED
# - Checking dist/agentic-scrum-setup-1.0.0b4.tar.gz: PASSED
```

**Step 2: Test PyPI Upload (Recommended)**
```bash
# Upload to Test PyPI for validation
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ agentic-scrum-setup==1.0.0b4

# Verify basic functionality
agentic-scrum-setup --help
```

**Step 3: Production PyPI Upload**
```bash
# Upload to production PyPI
twine upload dist/*

# Expected output:
# Uploading distributions to https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
# Uploading agentic_scrum_setup-1.0.0b4-py3-none-any.whl
# Uploading agentic-scrum-setup-1.0.0b4.tar.gz
```

### Phase 4: Global Verification

**Installation Testing:**
```bash
