### Integration with Existing MCP Servers

The enhanced QAA agent will integrate with:

1. **Agent Queue Server** (`mcp_servers/agent_queue/server.py`)
   - Task assignment and status management
   - Queue prioritization and load balancing
   - Result submission and retrieval

2. **Agent Monitor Server** (`mcp_servers/agent_monitor/server.py`)
   - Health monitoring and resource tracking
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Failure detection and recovery

3. **Agent Permissions Server** (`mcp_servers/agent_permissions/server.py`)
   - Autonomous decision approval
   - Resource access control
   - Operation authorization
