[Continue with detailed sections...]
```

#### 3. Update setup_core.py
**Location:** `agentic_scrum_setup/setup_core.py` (modify `_generate_documentation` method)
```python
def _generate_documentation(self):
    """Generate documentation files."""
    # Existing README generation...
    
    # Generate PROJECT_SCOPE.md
    project_scope = self.jinja_env.get_template('docs/PROJECT_SCOPE.md.j2').render(
        project_name=self.project_name,
        language=self.language,
        project_type=self.project_type
    )
    (self.project_path / 'docs' / 'PROJECT_SCOPE.md').write_text(project_scope)
    
    # Generate PROJECT_KICKOFF.md
    project_kickoff = self.jinja_env.get_template('docs/PROJECT_KICKOFF.md.j2').render(
        project_name=self.project_name,
        has_mcp=self.enable_mcp,
        has_search=self.enable_search,
        agents=self.agents
    )
    (self.project_path / 'docs' / 'PROJECT_KICKOFF.md').write_text(project_kickoff)
    
    # Continue with existing documentation...
```

#### 4. Update README.md.j2
**Location:** `agentic_scrum_setup/templates/README.md.j2` (after Getting Started section)
```markdown
## üöÄ Starting Development

2. **Follow the Guide** - Use `docs/PROJECT_KICKOFF.md` for step-by-step instructions
3. **Work with AI Agents** - Let Claude help create your initial backlog

> üí° **Tip**: The more detail you provide in PROJECT_SCOPE.md, the better your AI agents can help!
```

#### 5. Update CLAUDE.md.j2

```markdown
## Important Guidelines

1. **ALWAYS check `docs/PROJECT_SCOPE.md` first** - This contains the user's project requirements
2. If PROJECT_SCOPE.md is incomplete, help the user fill it out before proceeding
3. Use the scoping document to create initial user stories and development plans
