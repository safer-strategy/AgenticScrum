**Story Points:** 3  
**Priority:** P0 (High - Critical framework quality improvement)  
**Status:** In Review  
**Assigned To:** Claude + Human Collaboration  
**Created:** 2025-06-18  
**Start Date:** 2025-06-18 06:45  
**Last Update:** 2025-06-18 07:30  
**Completed:** [Phase 1-3 Complete]  

## üìã User Story

**As a developer using AgenticScrum,** I want sophisticated, language-specific AI agent personalities that generate high-quality, idiomatic code in their respective languages, **so that** the core value proposition of AI-driven development is realized with professional-grade code generation instead of generic fallbacks.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Template Quality**: All developer agents must have 200+ line sophisticated templates matching SAA/POA quality
- **Language Expertise**: Each agent must demonstrate deep language-specific knowledge and best practices
- **Human Feedback Loop**: Include mechanisms for continuous personality refinement based on real usage
- **Backward Compatibility**: New templates must work with existing AgenticScrum project structure

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

### Core Developer Agent Templates

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Current Architecture Analysis
**File:** `agentic_scrum_setup/setup_core.py`
- **Current Component/Function**: `_generate_agents()` (lines 406-468) - Uses generic template fallback for missing agent templates
- **Current Flow**: Check for specific template ‚Üí Fallback to generic ‚Üí Generate warning
- **Current State**: Only SAA, POA, SMA, QAA have sophisticated templates; all developer agents use generic fallback

### Required Changes

#### 1. Agent Template Creation
**Action:** Create comprehensive template files for all developer agents
```yaml
# Template structure for each deva_* agent
agentic_scrum_setup/templates/deva_python/

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ priming_script.md.j2

agentic_scrum_setup/templates/deva_typescript/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ persona_rules.yaml.j2
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ priming_script.md.j2

# ... for each language
```

#### 2. Template Content Architecture
**Current Implementation:** Generic 50-line template with basic capabilities
**New Implementation:** 200+ line sophisticated templates with:
```yaml

## üìö Human Collaboration Questions

As we implement this story, I'll need your guidance on several key decisions:

### Agent Personality Philosophy
1. **Code Generation Style**: Should agents prefer verbose/explicit code or concise/implicit patterns?
2. **Framework Opinions**: Should Python agents be opinionated about FastAPI over Flask, or remain framework-agnostic?
3. **Error Handling**: Defensive programming vs fail-fast approaches for different languages?

### Quality Standards
4. **Documentation Level**: How verbose should generated code comments be?
5. **Test Generation**: Should agents always generate tests, or only when explicitly requested?
6. **Performance Focus**: Generate optimized code initially, or optimize in refactoring phases?

### Agent Specialization Depth
7. **Language Versions**: Focus on latest language features (Python 3.11+) or maintain broader compatibility?
8. **Framework Expertise**: Deep specialization in primary frameworks vs broad ecosystem knowledge?
9. **Industry Patterns**: Enterprise patterns vs startup/agile patterns for different use cases?

Your input on these decisions will shape the personality and effectiveness of each agent, ensuring they align with real-world development practices and your vision for AgenticScrum's code generation quality.
