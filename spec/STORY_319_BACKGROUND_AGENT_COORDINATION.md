# Story 319: Background Agent Task Distribution and Coordination

**Epic:** E008 - Background Processing Enhancement  
**Story Points:** 2  
**Priority:** P1 (High - Critical for agent coordination efficiency)  
**Status:** To Do  
**Assigned To:** Claude + Human Collaboration  
**Created:** 2025-06-19  

## üìã User Story

**As a Scrum Master Agent (SMA) coordinating development work,** I want intelligent task distribution and agent coordination in the background system, **so that** agents can work efficiently together without conflicts, duplicate work, or resource contention while maintaining project quality and progress.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **SMA Integration**: Background system must coordinate with SMA for task prioritization and assignment
- **Agent Specialization**: Tasks routed to appropriate agents based on expertise and availability
- **Conflict Prevention**: Prevent multiple agents from working on the same files simultaneously
- **Work Coordination**: Ensure agent outputs complement rather than conflict with each other

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

### SMA Integration and Coordination
- [ ] **SMA Task Analysis**: SMA can analyze project state and generate background tasks
- [ ] **Priority Assignment**: SMA sets task priorities based on project needs and sprint goals
- [ ] **Agent Selection**: SMA selects appropriate agents for specific task types
- [ ] **Progress Monitoring**: SMA tracks background task progress and completion
- [ ] **Impediment Detection**: SMA identifies and escalates background task blockers

### Intelligent Task Distribution
- [ ] **Agent Expertise Matching**: Route tasks to agents with relevant specialization
- [ ] **Workload Balancing**: Distribute tasks evenly across available agents
- [ ] **Dependency Handling**: Sequence tasks that depend on each other's outputs
- [ ] **Resource Awareness**: Consider agent capacity and current workload
- [ ] **Context Preservation**: Maintain task context and requirements during distribution

### Conflict Prevention and Coordination
- [ ] **File Locking**: Prevent simultaneous file modifications by multiple agents
- [ ] **Work Coordination**: Share context between agents working on related tasks
- [ ] **Change Notification**: Notify agents when their work areas are modified
- [ ] **Merge Conflict Avoidance**: Coordinate changes to prevent git conflicts
- [ ] **Atomic Operations**: Ensure agent operations complete fully or not at all

### Task Orchestration Patterns
- [ ] **Sequential Workflows**: Chain tasks where output of one feeds into another
- [ ] **Parallel Processing**: Execute independent tasks simultaneously
- [ ] **Pipeline Processing**: Continuous flow of tasks through agent stages
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Group similar tasks for efficient processing
- [ ] **Conditional Execution**: Execute tasks based on project state or results

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Current Architecture Analysis
**File:** Background system from Story 318 provides basic task queuing
- **Current Component/Function**: `TaskQueue` (basic priority queue) - Simple FIFO with priority
- **Current Flow**: Enqueue task ‚Üí Dequeue by priority ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Complete
- **Current State**: No agent coordination, task distribution, or conflict prevention

### Required Changes

#### 1. SMA Background Integration
**Action:** Extend SMA to generate and coordinate background tasks
```python
class BackgroundSMAIntegration:
    def __init__(self, sma_config: dict, daemon: AgenticDaemon):
        self.sma = ScumMasterAgent(sma_config)
        self.daemon = daemon
        self.project_analyzer = ProjectStateAnalyzer()
    
    def analyze_and_queue_tasks(self):
        """SMA analyzes project and generates background tasks"""
        project_state = self.project_analyzer.get_current_state()
        tasks = self.sma.generate_background_tasks(project_state)
        for task in tasks:
            self.daemon.enqueue_task(task)
    
    def monitor_progress(self):
        """SMA monitors and coordinates background task progress"""
        pass
```

#### 2. Agent Coordination System
**Current Implementation:** No agent coordination or conflict prevention
**New Implementation:**
```python
class AgentCoordinator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent_capabilities = {}
        self.active_agents = {}
        self.file_locks = {}
        self.task_dependencies = DependencyGraph()
    
    def select_agent(self, task: AgentTask) -> str:
        """Select best agent for task based on expertise and availability"""
        pass
    
    def coordinate_execution(self, task: AgentTask) -> bool:
        """Coordinate task execution to prevent conflicts"""
        pass
    
    def handle_dependencies(self, tasks: List[AgentTask]) -> List[AgentTask]:
        """Order tasks based on dependencies"""
        pass
```

## üìö Implementation Examples

### SMA Background Task Generation
```python
# SMA analyzes project and generates tasks
project_state = {
    "modified_files": ["src/api/users.py", "src/models/user.py"],
    "sprint_goal": "Implement user authentication",
    "last_security_audit": "2025-06-15",
    "test_coverage": 75.2
}

# SMA generates appropriate background tasks
tasks = sma.generate_background_tasks(project_state)
# Output: [SecurityAuditTask(files=["src/api/users.py"]), 
#          TestCoverageTask(target=85), 
#          DocumentationUpdateTask(files=["src/models/user.py"])]
```

### Agent Coordination Example
```python
# Coordinator prevents conflicts
coordinator = AgentCoordinator()

# Task 1: SAA security audit on user.py
# Task 2: DEVA code review on user.py
# Coordinator ensures sequential execution to prevent conflicts

ordered_tasks = coordinator.handle_dependencies([
    SecurityAuditTask("src/models/user.py"),
    CodeReviewTask("src/models/user.py")
])
# Result: Security audit runs first, then code review uses audit results
```

### Workflow Pattern Usage
```yaml
# Coordination configuration
background:
  coordination:
    file_locking: true
    max_agents_per_file: 1
    dependency_resolution: true
    
  workflows:
    security_pipeline:
      - agent: saa
        task: security_scan
      - agent: deva_python
        task: fix_security_issues
        depends_on: security_scan
      - agent: qaa
        task: verify_fixes
        depends_on: fix_security_issues
```

This comprehensive coordination system will enable sophisticated multi-agent workflows while preventing conflicts and optimizing resource utilization across the background processing system.
