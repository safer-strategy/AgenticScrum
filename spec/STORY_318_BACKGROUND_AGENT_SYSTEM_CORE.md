# Story 318: Background Agent System Core Architecture

**Epic:** E008 - Background Processing Enhancement  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Priority:** P1 (High - Critical infrastructure for agent coordination)  
**Status:** To Do  
**Assigned To:** Claude  
**Created:** 2025-06-19  

## üìã User Story

**As a developer using AgenticScrum,** I want a background agent system that can run agents continuously without blocking my development workflow, **so that** agents can perform tasks like code analysis, security audits, and documentation updates automatically while I focus on active development.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Non-Blocking Operation**: Background system must not interfere with active development work
- **Resource Management**: Efficient CPU and memory usage with configurable limits
- **Process Isolation**: Background agents run in separate processes from main development tools
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean termination of background processes without data loss

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

### Core Daemon Architecture
- [ ] **Background Daemon Process**: Lightweight daemon that starts/stops with project initialization
- [ ] **Process Management**: Spawn, monitor, and terminate individual agent processes
- [ ] **Configuration Loading**: Read agent configurations from agentic_config.yaml
- [ ] **Logging System**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] **PID Management**: Track process IDs and prevent duplicate daemon instances

### Task Queue System
- [ ] **Task Queue Implementation**: In-memory queue for agent tasks with persistence options
- [ ] **Priority Handling**: Support high, medium, low priority task processing
- [ ] **Task Serialization**: Store and retrieve task data reliably
- [ ] **Queue Monitoring**: Track queue depth, processing rates, and task completion
- [ ] **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed tasks with exponential backoff

### Agent Process Management
- [ ] **Agent Spawning**: Launch individual agents as separate processes
- [ ] **Resource Limits**: Configure CPU, memory, and time limits per agent
- [ ] **Health Monitoring**: Detect crashed or hung agent processes
- [ ] **Automatic Restart**: Restart failed agents with configurable retry policies
- [ ] **Process Communication**: IPC mechanisms for daemon-to-agent communication

### Configuration and Control
- [ ] **CLI Integration**: Commands to start/stop/status background system
- [ ] **Hot Reload**: Reload agent configurations without full daemon restart
- [ ] **Development Mode**: Debug mode with verbose logging and single-threaded operation
- [ ] **Production Mode**: Optimized mode with resource limits and error handling

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Current Architecture Analysis
**File:** AgenticScrum currently has no background processing capability
- **Current Component/Function**: All agent interactions are synchronous and block development workflow
- **Current Flow**: User invokes CLI ‚Üí Agent executes ‚Üí User waits ‚Üí Results returned
- **Current State**: No persistent agent processes or background task handling

### Required Changes

#### 1. Background Daemon Infrastructure
**Action:** Create core daemon system for background agent management
```python
class AgenticDaemon:
    def __init__(self, config_path: str):
        self.config = self.load_config(config_path)
        self.task_queue = TaskQueue()
        self.agent_manager = AgentProcessManager()
        self.running = False
    
    def start(self):
        """Start the background daemon"""
        pass
    
    def stop(self):
        """Gracefully stop all processes"""
        pass
    
    def process_tasks(self):
        """Main event loop for task processing"""
        pass
```

#### 2. Task Queue System
**Current Implementation:** No task queuing system exists
**New Implementation:**
```python
class TaskQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = PriorityQueue()
        self.active_tasks = {}
        self.completed_tasks = deque(maxlen=1000)
    
    def enqueue(self, task: AgentTask, priority: int = 1):
        """Add task to queue with priority"""
        pass
    
    def dequeue(self) -> Optional[AgentTask]:
        """Get next task for processing"""
        pass
    
    def mark_complete(self, task_id: str, result: Any):
        """Mark task as completed"""
        pass
```

#### 3. Agent Process Management
**Requirements:**
- Spawn agents in separate processes with resource limits
- Monitor agent health and restart failed processes
- Provide IPC for task assignment and result collection
- Handle agent crashes gracefully

### Backend API Dependencies
**No Backend Changes Required** - This is a client-side background processing system that operates locally.
