# Story 317: AgenticScrum Remote Patching System

**Epic:** E007 - Developer Experience Enhancement  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Priority:** P1 (High - Critical developer workflow improvement)  
**Status:** Done  
**Assigned To:** Claude  
**Created:** 2025-06-18  
**Completed:** 2025-06-18 10:45  

## üìã User Story

**As a developer working on AgenticScrum projects,** I want a patching system that allows me to update the AgenticScrum framework from any project directory on the same computer, **so that** I can quickly apply fixes, enhancements, and new features to the framework without disrupting my current workflow or switching directories.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Framework Location Discovery**: Automatically locate AgenticScrum source directory regardless of current working directory
- **Version Control Integration**: All patches must be properly committed with descriptive messages and branch management
- **Non-Disruptive Workflow**: Allow patching from any project directory without breaking current work
- **Rollback Capability**: Provide ability to undo patches if they cause issues

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

### Core Patching Operations
- [ ] **Framework Discovery**: Automatically locate AgenticScrum installation from any directory on the computer
- [ ] **Add Template Operation**: `agentic-patch add-template <agent> <file>` - Add new agent templates to framework
- [ ] **Update MCP Service**: `agentic-patch update-mcp <file>` - Update MCP services and configurations
- [ ] **Fix CLI Issues**: `agentic-patch fix-cli <patch-file>` - Apply CLI bug fixes and enhancements
- [ ] **Add Commands**: `agentic-patch add-command <command-file>` - Add new CLI commands to framework
- [ ] **Sync Changes**: `agentic-patch sync-changes` - Sync local project changes back to framework

### Version Control Integration
- [ ] **Branch Management**: Create feature branches for patches automatically
- [ ] **Commit Automation**: Commit changes with descriptive messages and proper attribution
- [ ] **Tag Management**: Tag versions and manage releases appropriately
- [ ] **Rollback Support**: `agentic-patch rollback <patch-id>` - Undo specific patches
- [ ] **Change History**: `agentic-patch history` - View patch history and status

### Safety and Validation
- [ ] **Installation Validation**: Verify AgenticScrum installation and version compatibility
- [ ] **Patch Validation**: Test patches before applying to ensure they don't break functionality
- [ ] **Backup Creation**: Create automatic backups before applying patches
- [ ] **Conflict Detection**: Detect and resolve conflicts with existing changes
- [ ] **Dry Run Mode**: `agentic-patch --dry-run <operation>` - Preview changes without applying

### User Experience
- [ ] **Universal Access**: Work from any directory on the computer
- [ ] **Clear Feedback**: Provide clear success/error messages and progress indicators
- [ ] **Help System**: Comprehensive help for all patch operations
- [ ] **Status Reporting**: Show current patch status and pending changes

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Current Architecture Analysis
**File:** AgenticScrum is currently installed in editable mode at `/Users/mike/proj/AgenticScrum/`
- **Current Installation**: Editable pip installation allows direct source modifications
- **Current Flow**: Changes to source files immediately affect installed package
- **Current State**: No remote patching capability - must work within framework directory

### Required Changes

#### 1. Framework Location Discovery
**Action:** Create auto-discovery system for AgenticScrum installation
```python
def find_agentic_scrum_location():
    """Auto-discover AgenticScrum installation location."""
    # Check pip installation location
    import agentic_scrum_setup
    framework_path = Path(agentic_scrum_setup.__file__).parent.parent
    
    # Verify it's a valid AgenticScrum installation
    if (framework_path / 'agentic_scrum_setup').exists():
        return framework_path
    
    # Fallback methods for different installation types
    return None
```

#### 2. Patch Command Infrastructure
**Current Implementation:** No patching system exists
**New Implementation:**
```python
class AgenticPatcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.framework_path = self.discover_framework()
        self.git_repo = git.Repo(self.framework_path)
    
    def add_template(self, agent_type: str, template_file: str):
        """Add new agent template to framework."""
        pass
    
    def update_mcp(self, mcp_file: str):
        """Update MCP service files."""
        pass
    
    def fix_cli(self, patch_file: str):
        """Apply CLI bug fixes."""
        pass
```

#### 3. Git Integration System
**Requirements:**
- Automatic branch creation for patches
- Descriptive commit messages with patch metadata
- Tag management for version control
- Rollback capability with git reset/revert
- Conflict detection and resolution

### Backend API Dependencies
