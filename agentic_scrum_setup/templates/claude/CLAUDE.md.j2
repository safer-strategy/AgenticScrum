{{ project_name }} is an AgenticScrum-powered {{ language }} project. This project uses AI agents to assist with development following Scrum methodologies.

## Key Architecture & Structure

### Directory Structure
- `agents/` - AI agent configurations and personas
- `src/` - Source code for the application
- `tests/` - Test files mirroring the src structure
- `docs/` - Project documentation including user stories and architecture
- `standards/` - Coding standards and linter configurations
- `checklists/` - Quality checklists for various development phases
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts for automation

### Agent System
This project uses the following AI agents:
{% for agent in agents %}
- {{ agent }}
{% endfor %}
