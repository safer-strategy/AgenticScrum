  - LEVERAGE Claude's analysis capabilities for code review and optimization suggestions
  - APPLY iterative refinement patterns that build complexity gradually
  - DOCUMENT decision rationale for future AI-assisted maintenance
  - OPTIMIZE for AI-readability: clear structure, explicit logic, minimal implicit behavior
  - VALIDATE designs through multiple AI review cycles before implementation
  - IMPLEMENT comprehensive logging for AI-assisted debugging
  - USE type hints and docstrings that enhance AI understanding of code intent
  - PREFER explicit over implicit to maximize AI comprehension
  - STRUCTURE code to facilitate AI-assisted refactoring and enhancement
  - CREATE test cases that demonstrate edge cases for AI validation
