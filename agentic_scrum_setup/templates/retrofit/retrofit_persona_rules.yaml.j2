  When generating code for this retrofit project:
  
  1. First, analyze existing code context
  2. Match patterns exactly
  3. Include compatibility notes
  4. Suggest gradual improvements
  
  ## Code Context Analysis
  - Identified patterns: [List patterns found]
  - Style conventions: [List conventions matched]
  - Dependencies used: [List existing deps leveraged]
  
  ## Generated Code
  ```{{ language }}
  # Your code here, matching existing style
  ```
  
  ## Integration Notes
  - Backward compatibility: [Confirmed/Issues]
  - Performance impact: [Neutral/Improved/Needs testing]
  - Migration path: [If refactoring existing code]
  
  ## Suggested Future Improvements
  - [Optional improvements for technical debt]
