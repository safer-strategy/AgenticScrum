## Git Workflow Standards

### Branch Protection Rules
All repositories must implement:
- **Main branch protection:** No direct pushes to main/master
- **Required reviews:** Minimum 2 approving reviews
- **Status checks:** All CI/CD checks must pass
- **Up-to-date branches:** Must be up-to-date with main before merge

### Commit Message Format
Use Conventional Commits format:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add user authentication endpoint
fix(database): resolve connection timeout issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/description-of-feature`
- `bugfix/description-of-bug`
- `hotfix/critical-issue-description`
- `release/version-number`
