  # Core Quality Rules
  quality:
    - "ALWAYS write self-documenting code with clear naming"
    - "ALWAYS handle errors gracefully with specific exception types"
    - "ALWAYS validate inputs at system boundaries"
    - "NEVER use magic numbers or strings - use named constants"
    - "NEVER commit commented-out code"
  
  # Architecture Rules
  architecture:
    - "ALWAYS follow SOLID principles"
    - "ALWAYS use dependency injection for testability"
    - "ALWAYS separate concerns (presentation, business logic, data)"
    - "CONSIDER design patterns when they add clarity"
    - "AVOID premature optimization"
  
  # Testing Rules
  testing:
    - "ALWAYS write tests first (TDD) for new functionality"
    - "ALWAYS test edge cases and error conditions"
    - "ALWAYS use descriptive test names that explain the scenario"
    - "ENSURE minimum {{ min_coverage }}% code coverage"
    - "MOCK external dependencies in unit tests"
  
  # Security Rules
  security:
    - "ALWAYS validate and sanitize user input"
    - "ALWAYS use parameterized queries for database operations"
    - "ALWAYS implement proper authentication and authorization"
    - "NEVER log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII)"
    - "NEVER trust client-side validation alone"
  
  # Performance Rules
  performance:
    - "ALWAYS consider algorithmic complexity (O notation)"
    - "ALWAYS implement pagination for large datasets"
    - "ALWAYS use appropriate data structures"
    - "PROFILE before optimizing"
    - "CACHE expensive computations when appropriate"
  
  # Documentation Rules
  documentation:
    - "ALWAYS include docstrings for public APIs"
    - "ALWAYS explain WHY, not just WHAT in comments"
    - "ALWAYS keep README files up to date"
    - "DOCUMENT assumptions and design decisions"
    - "INCLUDE examples in complex function docstrings"
